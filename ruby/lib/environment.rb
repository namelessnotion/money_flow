# Eager-loads every application file. `Sequel::Model.inherited` issues a real schema
# query when a model class is defined, so this needs a live, migrated database — it
# isn't a pure load step.
#
# Used by spec/spec_helper.rb and by sorbet/tapioca/compilers/sequel_model.rb, which
# has no other way to make models visible to `gather_constants` (`tapioca dsl` only
# knows how to boot Rails apps).
